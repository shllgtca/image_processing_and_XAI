Tasks : Image_processing and XAI


This repository has a general notebook used for image processing and XAI tasks. A public train/val/test dataset will be added soon. 


The notebook is set to iterate through different image processing tasks in order to compare the results, for example: one model could differentiate eletricity meters caracteristics, such as eletromecanic vs eletronic, and the other could diferentiate the number of phases of the eletricity meter.
